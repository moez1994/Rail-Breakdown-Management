Mobile application project for the management of breakdowns on the railways.
During the inspection of the track, the technician can detect defects, and he must report them to the technical team. The latter receives this request for intervention, and the people of this team will come to the site and do whatever it takes to remedy it.
For this, after authentication, the technician inspecting the railway tracks posts an anomaly on the application with the description, the GPS coordinates of the avalanche and the date of the avalanche.
